## Description & Contributors

This is an open source project for creating a platform for dual job dating. The project is developed by students of Mobile Software Development (MSD21) at the University of Applied Studies in Kapfenberg, Austria. The project was supervised by FH-Prof. DI Dr. Elmar Krainz, DI (FH) Michael Ulm, MA, and DI (FH) Andreas Ã–ffl, MSc.

## Installation

The project is divided into three parts.. The frontend consists of a Flutter application and an Angular application, while the backend is a ASP.NET Core application. The following instructions will guide you through the installation process.

### Installation steps

#### Flutter App

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/FH-JOANNEUM-MSD/dual-job-date-mobile)

2. Navigate to the `dual-job-date-mobile` directory

3. Install Flutter [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

4. Run the application with an emulator or your physical device as an emulator

## Technical Details

### Tech stack

#### BLoC

[Link to the library](https://bloclibrary.dev/)

We used the BLoC library (Business Logic Component) in our project to seperate the presentation from business logic, be able to code fast and most importantly, make the code reusable.

BLoC was created so the developer

- knows what the state of the application is at any point
- can easily test every case to make sure the app is responding appropriatly
- record every single user interaction in the application so data-driven decisions can be made
- can work as efficiently as possible and reuse components both within the application and across other applications
- can have many developers working seamlessly within a single code base following the same patterns and conventions
- develop fast and reactive apps

In all places, where a connection to the Rest API is required, BLoC is used.

For more details read [here](https://github.com/FH-JOANNEUM-MSD/dual-job-date-mobile/blob/development/README.md).

#### ASP.NET Core App

The ASP.NET Core App leverages a modern and robust technology stack designed to support scalable and secure web applications:

- **Framework**: [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)

  - The latest iteration of Microsoft's .NET framework, providing advanced features for building high-performance applications.

### Architecture

#### App Development with Flutter

![Flutter Architecture](Assets/flutter.png)

- UI Layer: Uses singular components for screens, focusing on user experienceâ€‹

- BLoC Layer: Interface between UI and Services. Manages state and separates business logic for readabilityâ€‹

- Services Layer: Contains logic for external interactions like API calls. Aimed at decoupling the application core from external dependenciesâ€‹

- Additional Classes: Enhances code with static helpers for UI consistency and validation

#### Web Development with Angular

![Angular Architecture](Assets/web.png)

- Model: Encapsulates the application's business objects, holding data. It's the reusable code part that simply manages the data of the applicationâ€‹

- View: What the user ultimately sees. It's the platform-specific UI that displays formatted data. The View is designed to present data contained in the Modelâ€‹

- ViewModel: Acts as the link between the Model and View, handling logic and data preparation for the View. It retrieves data from the Model and formats it for presentationâ€‹

#### Backend Development with ASP.NET Core

![ASP.NET Core Architecture](Assets/backend.png)

- API Layer: Interfaces with the client side, handling HTTP requests via Controllers. â€‹

- Business Logic Layer: Processes business operations, implemented by Services, and aided by Helper functions for shared utility tasks.â€‹

- Data Access Layer: Manages the data lifecycle with Repositories handling data transactions and the Unit of Work ensuring data integrity.â€‹

- Business Objects: Comprise DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and Entities, forming the data structure used across Business Logic and Data Access layers.â€‹

- Database Initialization: Involves DbInitializer for database setup and DbSeeder for seeding initial data.â€‹

- .NET Core Identity: Secures the application with comprehensive user and role management using UserManager, SignInManager, and RoleManager.â€‹

### Database schema

![Database Schema](Assets/db.png)

- User and Role Entities: Core Identity framework entities where User inherits from IdentityUser and Role from IdentityRole, central to the system's security and access management.â€‹

- UserType Enumerations: Specific roles including Admin, Institution, Company, and Student, dictating access privileges and functional scope within the system.â€‹

- Institution and Academic Program Relationships: Hierarchical relation where Institutions may contain multiple Academic Programs, integral for structuring the educational offerings within the system.â€‹

- Company and Academic Engagement: Defines the linkage between companies and academic programs, vital for capturing interactions such as internships.â€‹

- Seeding and Initial Data: DbSeeder's role in populating the database with initial, essential data sets, such as predefined user roles and academic program details.â€‹

### CI/CD

This project utilizes Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) to streamline development and deployment processes. CI/CD ensures that code changes are automatically tested, integrated, and deployed, providing rapid feedback and reducing the risk of integration issues. To implement the cicd process, a separate github actions pipeline was created for web-,mobile-,backend-development.
Feedback on if a workflow run was successful gets automatically sent to a discord group.

#### Backend/API

The CI/CD pipeline for the Dual Job Dating project, defined in a YAML file for GitHub Actions, triggers on push or pull request events to the cicd/notification branch. It includes four main jobs: build, test, build-and-push-docker, and notification jobs for failure and success. The build job checks out the code, sets up .NET Core, restores dependencies, builds the project, and caches NuGet packages. The test job runs the project tests after the build job. The build-and-push-docker job logs into GitHub Container Registry, builds, and pushes the Docker image. The pipeline requires manual deployment to a Kubernetes cluster and has permissions to read contents and write packages.

#### Web

The Dual Job Dating Web CI/CD Pipeline for the Angular project automates building, testing, and deployment to the GitHub Container Registry, triggered by push or pull request events to the main branch, and release creation. The pipeline includes three main jobs: test, build, and deploy. The test job checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs tests. The build job checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, generates the API, builds the application, and saves the build artifact. The deploy job checks out the code, converts the repository name to lowercase, downloads the build artifact, logs into the GitHub Container Registry, and builds and pushes the Docker image. Manual deployment to a Kubernetes cluster is required.

#### Mobile

The Dual Job Dating Mobile CI/CD Pipeline for the Flutter project automates building, testing, signing and in the future deployment to the playstore and appstore. The build and test steps are triggered on push or pull request events to the main branch, the deployment step is triggered by realease creation on the main branch. The test job checks out the code, sets up flutter, caches the flutter dependencies, installs dependencies and runs tests. The build job separated for iOS and Android automatically builds and signs the app bundles, currently they get stored as a workflow artifact, with automatic deployment to internal playstore tracks and testflight (defined in the deployment steps) in the works.
